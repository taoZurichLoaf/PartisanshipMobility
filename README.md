**Abstract**

Facing the outbreak of COVID-19, various travel restrictions were imposed in the US. Previous research indicated a correlation between political partisanship and peopleâ€™s behavior, including whether to avoid traveling. This study investigates the changes in human mobility and their association with political partisanship during the first wave of the pandemic. The partisanship index is synthesized from the US presidential election voting data. Daily mobility volume is measured from dynamic origin-destination mobility matrices at county level. We identify the breakpoint of each county, a day when the daily mobility volume has an abrupt change. The changes in mobility are measured by three indicators: 1) Mobility Volume Difference before and after the breakpoint, 2)Before-break Trend, 3) After-break Trend. We find that people reduced traveling simultaneously even though the travel restrictions were imposed on different dates across the states. However, Democratic counties experienced the largest drop in mobility volume. People living there continued to avoid traveling towards the end of the first wave, when those in Swing and Republican counties ceased to do so.
